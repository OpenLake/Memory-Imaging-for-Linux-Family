## Documentation Instructions:
1.) install doxygen
2.) run Doxyfile with doxygen (type "doxygen Doxyfile" in the terminal while in the toothbrush directory) after completing your work
3.) commit the changes of Doumentation folder in the branch

## How to document:
In short the config file that I have made will read the comment in the format:
/// Brief overview of function or class
///
///Detailed description of function or class
/// @param FunctionParameter details of FunctionParameter
/// #classMember yada yada
Do note that these comments are to be included before the class or function to be described
